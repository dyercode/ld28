	You must place components between the magic cannon in such a way that they process with the desired properties.
	Click to pick up a component, click again to deposit it on an open slot.  Leaving empty space will allow raw magic to escape in a bloody explosion and you will lose your machine and probably be caught up in it and die too! Click go to run your configuration.  Press any key to get back to the game after the process has run.
